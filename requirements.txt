We're building a simple interface that makes it easy to:

- Search OMDB and display the results (movies only)
- Add a movie from the search results to our nomination list
- View the list of films already nominated
- Remove a nominee from the nomination list


Requirements:

[x] Search results should come from OMDB's API (free API key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
[x] Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film.
[x] Updates to the search terms should update the result list.
[x] Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list.
[] If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button.
[] Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.
